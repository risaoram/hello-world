# hello-world
My first Git Hub repository :)
I'm super new to the world of GitHub and basically have no programming skills, but in my mind I'm already programming with deep neural networks and solving the world's most important problems. hahah hope you had a good laugh.
Changes in this version are that I added a bit about myself and am going to commit to the changes.
